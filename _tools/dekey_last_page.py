"""Take the flat background off the end-screen clip and ship it with real alpha.

Run from the repo root:  python _tools/dekey_last_page.py

THE BACKGROUND IS NOT A SCENE. Both versions that have arrived carry a stand-in for
transparency: the GIF had the export's checkerboard baked in ((252,252,255) / (252,252,170)),
the video has a near-white sweep of neutral greys (241-255). Either is keyable exactly - but a
plain colour key would also eat the bird, whose own white is (255,255,255), the brightest colour
in the frame. So the key is FLOOD-FILLED FROM THE BORDER: only background-coloured pixels
reachable from outside go, and whatever the silhouette encloses survives, whatever colour it is.
Same reasoning as the walking-animal GIFs earlier in this project.

OUTPUT IS WEBP, NOT GIF. GIF alpha is one all-or-nothing index and this art has soft edges, which
cut hard fringe against the sunburst behind them. Pillow in this environment cannot WRITE an
animated WebP (no SAVE_ALL handler), so the frames go out as PNGs and ffmpeg assembles them.

AND IT IS HALVED. The first pass, 156 frames at 344x460, came to 4.6MB - more than the rest of
the game's art together, for a screen the child sees once. Every second frame at 12fps still
reads as a cheer; this is a bounce loop, not a mouth that has to stay in sync.
