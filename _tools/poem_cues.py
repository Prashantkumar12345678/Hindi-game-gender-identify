"""Word onset times for the poem clips, measured off the audio itself.

WHY NOT AN EVEN SPLIT: [H11-60] already learned this on the sentence re-read - words are not
evenly spaced in speech and a flat cadence drifts off the voice within two words. A poem is
worse: it is read in phrases with a real breath between the lines.

WHY NOT PURE SILENCE DETECTION EITHER: in a sung-ish reading "shern aayi" has no gap in it at
all, so silences find PHRASES, not words. So: silence gives us the phrase boundaries, which are
the honest part of the measurement, and inside a phrase the words are laid out by WEIGHT - the
count of aksharas, which is what actually takes time to say in Devanagari.
