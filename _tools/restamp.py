"""Give every asset URL a fresh ?v= token, so a replaced file actually reaches the browser.

The token exists because assets live at fixed paths: re-recording a clip or redrawing a button
changes the FILE and not its URL, and a browser holding the old bytes never asks again. That cost
most of an afternoon - a corrected clip reported wrong three times while the server had the right
one - and then cost it AGAIN, because the token was written once and I kept editing assets
underneath it. A stamp that never changes is a stamp that stops working.

So: run this after ANY asset changes, before committing. It takes a second and it is the only
thing standing between a fixed asset and a child still getting the old one.
