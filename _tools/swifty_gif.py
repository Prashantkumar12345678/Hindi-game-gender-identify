"""Swifty arrives - a GIF built from ONE still (assets/UI/start_mascot.png).

Nothing is drawn that is not already in the picture: the bird is moved, turned, squashed and
scaled, which is all a still can honestly give. He runs in from the left on an arc, lands with a
squash, and then sways on the spot as if waving - the wave reads because the arm is ALREADY up in
the source art, so the sway carries it.
No text anywhere, as asked.
