"""Swifty talking, full body, on a TRANSPARENT ground - for the transition screen.

Same hinge as the head version: the red mouth band squashes, the lower beak rides up rigidly by
what the gap lost, and the strip it vacates is repainted from what is behind the beak.

TWO THINGS DIFFER HERE.

1. The plate cannot just blend left-to-right. On the head art both sides of the beak were clean
   cream; on the full body the jacket collar reaches in on the RIGHT at the rows just under the
   beak (sampled: y=300 gives (97,124,139) and (227,166,50) - outline and jacket, not face). A
   straight blend would have painted collar onto the chin. So each row checks both samples and
   falls back to the good one when the other is not face-coloured.

2. It has to sit on the gate's dark scrim, so the background must be transparent rather than a
   colour. GIF transparency is one index, all or nothing, so the alpha is cut hard at the
   halfway mark - which this art can take, because it is drawn with a white sticker outline that
   gives the silhouette its own edge.
