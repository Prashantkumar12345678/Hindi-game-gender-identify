"""Swifty talking - a GIF built from ONE still (assets/UI/sw_head_talking.webp).

No text anywhere.

THE JAW IS CUT OUT AND HINGED. The two head poses that exist - neutral and talking - are framed
differently (different zoom, one hand up), so cutting between them reads as a jump rather than as
speech. So one image is used and the mouth is worked inside it:
  the red mouth band is squashed vertically  -> the gap closes,
  the lower beak below it is carried up rigidly by exactly what the gap lost -> a real jaw keeps
  its shape, it does not shrink,
  and the strip the jaw vacates is repainted from what is BEHIND the beak.

That last part took three goes. A patch lifted from a strip further down painted chest onto face;
a patch taken from the rows just below the beak tip dragged a fragment of the chest's V-line up
with it. Both left a pale rectangle under the jaw. The honest source is sideways: at any row
through the beak, the pixels just outside it left and right ARE the surface it sits on.

The RHYTHM is syllables, not a sine. A mouth opening and closing evenly reads as a machine; real
speech is uneven, and it SHUTS between words. So the timeline is a list of syllables with their
own lengths and heights, with real pauses written in.
